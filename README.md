# Advanced-Price-Discounting-PD-Models

## Objective 
Optimization of Annual Savings through Advanced Price Discounting (PD) Models

## Data Description
The sample datasets are in `Excel` format. 

## Description
- Improved savings through the implementation of PD Models. Executed meticulous data cleaning, join operations, and EDA within
designated groups for Daily, Weekly, and Monthly analyses. Introduced Area Sales Officer (ASO) Bais Weight calculation to refine
Whole Sale Price (WSP) adjustments, employing Mean Percentile Rank and Bias Correction technique for ASO.

- Applied a multifaceted approach to estimate Adjusted WSP, incorporating N-1, N-2, IQR CV, Median, and Bias Weight Methods.
Selected three out of five methods based on specific business requirements. Developed a novel Dealer Size PD computation
methodology leveraging the varying District Discount Factor and Adjusted WSP.

- Prevented the big dealers from unequal PD gain and helped the small dealers to get appropriate PD by decreasing the overall PD
and stabilizing the WSP. Enhanced yearly saving by 7.5 crore approx. at National Level, meticulously estimating savings at each
District, State, and Region. Validated results through multiple statistical tests, including chi-square, student t-test, and ANOVA.
